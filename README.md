# ðŸ¥· J is for ninJa notes 
This is a spellbook.

I use GitHub issues as my learning blog for keeping notes.

## Homepage

1. Keep an idea or a recipe in the [`Issue`](https://github.com/tsai-jiewen/ninja/issues) section.
2. Organize these recipes/issues in the `Wiki` section (aka the cookbook/ninja).
3. Upload Jupyter notebooks and qmd files to the `Code` section.
